# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I only support the latest version of Relevanssi.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Best way to report vulnerabilities is an email to Mikko Saari at
mikko@mikkosaari.fi. Mikko responds to security incidents as fast as
possible, generally within one business day.
